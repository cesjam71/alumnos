Walking down the street tonight
I got my share of bad intentions
I don't know what's wrong or right
And did I forget to mention
It makes me wonder, I kinda wonder
I wonder how you look so right
It don't matter, it doesn't matter
If soon you're out of sight
Alright now, are you on my side
How I've got a secret to tell you
'Cause I know that you haven't heard
But what if I told you just how much I need you
I've got some news to tell you
Do you need me too?
You got me staring like a fool
Yeah I know you want me too
When you look back at me
Ah girl, I know you get me
My eyes and your eyes
The sunlight, it's alright
Yeah, how could I look right past ya
You got me staring at ya
hola
